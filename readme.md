# L.S.M-OS
A System Management UI made to run off of Windows.
##### (LSM-OS is **very** unfinished and currently lacks many of the mentioned features.)
#

### "What is it? Why should I use it?"
LSM-OS is more or less just for managing things like uptime, files, running and debugging code, etc.

It is also made with the intention to look pretty, so you can flex on your friends about how cool your Spotify app is. (and how many resources it uses... :p)

## Features
- Basic functions like clock, welcome message, MoTD, and resource usage (like Task Manager).
- Internal property system, meaning you can alter existing properties, or create new ones, and have them run like mods at runtime. [All with nothing but Notepad. ðŸš§]
- Screensaver [ðŸš§]
- Script Editor [ðŸš§]
- Script templates [ðŸš§]
- looks cool ðŸ˜Ž
- Spotify Control [ðŸš§]
- Discord Integration [ðŸš§]
- Built-in Theme Editor with support for *custom themes*. [ðŸš§]

## Notes
LSM-OS is a passion-project. The code is messy and everywhere, optimizations are very possible, and editing it to fit your needs is up to you.
